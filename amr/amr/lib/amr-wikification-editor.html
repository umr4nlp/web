    <h2>Login to AMR Editor</h2>
    <ul>
       <li> Go to <a href="http://www.isi.edu/amr/amr/AMR-editor.html" target="AMR_Editor">http://www.isi.edu/amr/amr/AMR-editor.html</a>
       <li> Login in with your <b>personal</b> AMR Editor username and the password that you selected
       <li> Bookmark the AMR Editor as http://www.isi.edu/amr/amr/AMR-editor.html (not as ...cgi)
    </ul>
    <h2>Load workset and start wikification editor</h2>
    <ul>
       <li> On AMR Editor main page, click on blue <b>load</b> button.
       <li> Fill in annotator (often <b>group</b> rather than personal): cjconsensus | colorado | ldcpreferred | rpi
       <li> Fill in workset name. If you don't remember the exact workset name, leave blank, and later select from menu.
       <li> Click on gray <b>Load workset at ISI</b> button.
       <li> After you are in the right workset, click on blue <b>wiki</b> button. This will dynamically generate an AMR Wikification Editor page. That might take several seconds.
    </ul>
    <h2>Inside the AMR Wikification Editor</h2>
    <ul>
       <li> At the top you will find a status summary and brief instructions.
       <li> Named entities to be wikified are shown on the right.
       <li> Underlined items (full or dotted) are sensitive to mouse-over and click operations.
       <li> Click on an underlined named entity (NE) to invoke a mini-menu for that NE. If the
	    underline is dashed, no RPI wikification is available.
	   <ul>
	      <li> Select the correct wikification if available.
	      <li> You can mouse-over RPI suggestions to see a brief summary of the wikipedia entry to help make sure it's the right one.
	      <li> Click on the Google icon ("G") to search Google in wikipedia for the NE. Cut and paste the wiki title from any successful Google search into the AMR Wikification Editor, which will automatically do minor reformatting (e.g. replace spaces by underscores).
	      <li> Select/type in a simple dash ("-") if no wiki page exists for the named entity.
	      <li> The wiki page you select should not be a redirection page or a disambiguation page.
	   </ul>
       <li> If you are <b>not sure</b> how to wikify, or if you think that the underlying 
	    named entity is incorrect (wrong type, wrong scope, or shouldn't even 
	    be a named entity in the first place), use a question mark ("?") as a 
	    wikification value. This signals a problem case to a wikification expert. 
	    If there is no wiki page, choose a simple dash ("-").
       <li> Super important: <b>Save</b> your wikifications (at bottom of page).
            You don't have to wikify everything on the page before saving.
    </ul>
