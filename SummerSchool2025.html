                        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Participation will be fully supported (reasonable airfare, lodging, and meals). This summer school has been made possible 
                            by funding from NSF <i>Collaborative Research: Building a Broad Infrastructure for Uniform Meaning Representations</i> (Award # 2213805), 
                            with additional support from Brandeis University.</b></p><br>

                        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Impressive progress has been made in many aspects of natural language processing (NLP) in recent years. Most notably, 
                            the achievements of transformer-based large language models such as ChatGPT would seem to obviate the need for any type 
                            of semantic representation beyond what can be encoded as contextualized word embeddings of surface text. Advances have 
                            been particularly notable in areas where large training data sets exist, and it is advantageous to build an end-to-end 
                            training architecture without resorting to intermediate representations. For any truly interactive NLP applications, 
                            however, a more complete understanding of the information conveyed by each sentence is needed to advance the state of 
                            the art. Here, "understanding'' entails the use of some form of meaning representation. NLP techniques that can accurately 
                            capture the required elements of the meaning of each utterance in a formal representation are critical to making progress 
                            in these areas and have long been a central goal of the field. As with end-to-end NLP applications, the dominant approach 
                            for deriving meaning representations from raw textual data is through the use of machine learning and appropriate training 
                            data. This allows the development of systems that can assign appropriate meaning representations to previously unseen text. </p><br>

                        <p style="font-size: 18px;"> In this five-day course, instructors from the University of Colorado and Brandeis University will describe the framework 
                            of Uniform Meaning Representations (UMRs), a recent cross-lingual, multi-sentence incarnation of Abstract Meaning Representations 
                            (AMRs), that addresses these issues and comprises such a transformative representation. Incorporating Named Entity tagging, 
                            discourse relations, intra-sentential coreference, negation and modality, and the popular PropBank-style predicate argument 
                            structures with semantic role labels into a single directed acyclic graph structure, UMR builds on AMR and keeps the essential 
                            characteristics of AMR while making it cross-lingual and extending it to be a document-level representation. It also adds aspect, 
                            multi-sentence coreference and temporal relations, and scope. Each day will include lectures and hands-on practice. </p><br>
