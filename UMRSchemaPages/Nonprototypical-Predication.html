<h1>Nonprototypical Predication:</h1>
    
<p>These rolesets cover several semantic categories whose predication is often expressed non-prototypically across many languages (via copular expressions, juxtaposition, etc.). For possession and location, many languages distinguish thetic from predicational expressions of information status (meaning they distinguish which arguments are new or old information). These categories are arranged into lattices so that users may choose whether or not to annotate this level of detail.</p>
<p>(Current as of June 2025.)</p>

<p>Note: it is always possible that lexeme-specific rolesets may be created and used in place of these. Ideally, those rolesets should include in their lexical files an indication which of these categories they fall under.</p>

      <td class="definition">Predication of properties. Pay close attention and make sure to annotate the overall <em>main point</em> of the proposition. Sometimes, predication of properties is packaged in such a way that it looks like object predication. This occurs sometimes when a copular construction is used with a noun phrase as the direct object, but the noun is not the main idea being conveyed-- it's just a carrier (already known information) for the property, which is presented as a modifier (e.g., an adjective). For example, consider the difference between <em>"We studied Shakespeare, Napoleon, and Muhammed. These are Great Men according to Carlyle's Great Men Theory."</em>, <em>"both of my grandfathers were great men"</em>, and <em>"these men are great".</em> The first example is object predication because "Great Men" is a Named Entity, a category in and of itself. In the second, we understand that my grandfathers are men, and the main point of the sentence is that they were great even though this property is embedded inside a redundant NP-- so have-mod-91 is a better option. The general idea is that a speaker might say <em>"These men are great"</em> or <em>"These are great men"</em> to convey the same main idea, and we want the annotations to be the same because UMR is supposed to be highlighting semantics over syntax.
