The goal of the  Uniform Meaning
Representation (UMR) project is to design  a meaning representation that can be used
to annotate the semantic content of a text. UMR
is primarily based on Abstract Meaning Representation
(AMR), an annotation framework initially designed for
English, but also draws from other meaning representations.
UMR extends AMR to other languages, particularly
morphologically complex, low-resource languages.
UMR also adds features to AMR that are critical
to semantic interpretation and enhances AMR by proposing a companion document-level representation
that captures linguistic phenomena such as coreference
as well as temporal and modal dependencies that potentially
go beyond sentence boundaries. UMR is intended to be
scalable, learnable, and cross-linguistically plausible. It is designed to support both lexical and logical inference.-->
