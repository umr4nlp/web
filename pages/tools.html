<h2>Nils Reiter</h2>
<h2>Beyond the Mold: New Paths for Annotation Science</h2>
-->

<!-- abstract here
<p>
In the most recent years, the field of computational literary studies has
emerged, sometimes called a ‘little sister/brother’ of computational
linguistics. The underlying assumptions, text types, and annotation categories
pose new challenges to the established annotation workflow. In the talk, Nils
Reiter will discuss two potential  new directions for the systematic use and
study of annotation as a scientific method. Focussing on the text type ‘literary
text', he will discuss the impact of textual characteristics and  annotation
category choices on annotation procedures, metrics, and tools. With an (even
more) methodological focus, he will report and reflect on experiences made in
the shared task SANTA, which at the moment has the collaborative and competitive
development of annotation guidelines as its goal. In both directions, linguistic
concepts interact with non-linguistic ones in a way that can be fruitful for
both fields.
